## A.1 Proof of Minimum Entropy Maintenance

**Lemma 1**: Given $n$ nodes with individual min-entropy $H_{\infty}(n_i) \geq h_{\text{min}}$, the system has aggregate entropy bounded below.

*Modified Proof*:
- For independent entropy sources: $H(S) \geq \max(H(n_1), H(n_2), \ldots, H(n_n)) \geq h_{\text{min}}$
- For partially correlated sources: $H(S) \geq H_{\infty}(\text{combined sources})$ 
- **Note**: Linear additivity $H(S) = \sum H(n_i)$ only holds for perfectly independent sources, which is unrealistic in networked systems
- Conservative bound: $H(S) \geq h_{\text{min}}$ ensures minimum security threshold ✓

## A.2 DHT Lookup Complexity Proof

**Lemma 2**: In a Kademlia DHT with $n$ nodes, the expected number of lookup hops is $O(\log n)$.

*Proof*: 
- Each routing step eliminates at least half the remaining search space
- Expected hops $\leq \log_2(n/k)$ where $k$ is the bucket size
- With entropy injection, additional $O(1)$ operations don't change asymptotic complexity
- Total: $O(\log n) + O(1) = O(\log n)$ ✓

**Lemma 3**: Entropy injection maintains DHT correctness while adding security.

*Proof*:
- XOR distance metric: $d(x,y) = x \oplus y$ remains consistent
- Random hash $h = \text{SHA3}(\text{taskID} || \text{entropy})$ preserves uniform distribution over key space
- Closest node property maintained: $\forall h, \exists$ unique closest node $n_i$ where $d(h, n_i)$ is minimal
- Therefore, DHT routing correctness is preserved ✓

## A.3 DHT Security Proofs

**Theorem 5**: The probability of DHT eclipse attack success is negligible with entropy augmentation.

*Proof*:
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be adversary controlling $m < n/3$ nodes. For eclipse attack on target $T$:
- Adversary must either: (1) predict lookup key $k = \text{SHA3}(\text{taskID} || \text{entropy})$, OR (2) control surrounding nodes
- Probability of predicting entropy: $P_{\text{entropy}} \leq 2^{-256}$ (SHA-3 security [30])
- Probability of controlling $k$ nearest nodes: $P_{\text{surround}} \leq (m/n)^k$ (uniform distribution [4])
- Since entropy prevents targeted positioning, adversary can only rely on random chance
- Eclipse probability: $P_{\text{eclipse}} \leq \min(1, (m/n)^k)$ for $m < n/2$
- Example: $n=1000$, $m=100$, $k=20$: $P_{\text{eclipse}} = (0.1)^{20} = 10^{-20}$ ✓

## A.4 VRF Security Analysis

**Theorem 6**: The probability of successful Sybil attack with $m$ malicious nodes among $n$ total nodes is bounded by $(m/n)^k$ where $k$ is the consensus threshold.

*Proof*: VRF output is uniformly distributed in $[0, 2^{256})$. For $k$ independent selections, probability of all selecting malicious nodes $= (m/n)^k$. For $n=1000$, $m=100$, $k=5$: $P < 10^{-5}$.
