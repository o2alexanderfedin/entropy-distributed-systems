# Patent Innovation Document #4: Time-Bounded Ephemeral Private Cloud Infrastructure

**Technology Area**: Cloud Computing, Secure Multi-Party Computation, Data Privacy  
**Innovation Type**: System and Method  
**AI-Assisted Development**: Yes - Developed with substantial contributions from AI Hive®  

## 1. Title of Invention

**System and Method for Cryptographically-Enforced Time-Bounded Cloud Computing with Automatic Dissolution and Zero-Residue Data Destruction**

## 2. Field of Invention

This invention relates to cloud computing infrastructure, specifically to methods for creating temporary, self-dissolving computational environments with cryptographic guarantees of complete data elimination after predetermined time periods.

## 3. Background and Problem Statement

### Current Cloud Infrastructure Limitations

1. **Persistent Attack Surface**
   - Infrastructure remains vulnerable indefinitely
   - Configuration drift accumulates over time
   - Security patches create maintenance windows
   - Compromise persists until detected

2. **Data Residue Problem**
   - Deleted data often recoverable
   - No cryptographic proof of destruction
   - GDPR compliance difficult to prove
   - Forensic recovery remains possible

3. **Maintenance Window Requirements**
   - System downtime for updates
   - User disruption during upgrades
   - Complex rollback procedures
   - Business continuity challenges

4. **Cross-Project Contamination**
   - Shared infrastructure between projects
   - Data leakage possibilities
   - IP protection challenges
   - Audit scope expansion

### The Ephemeral Cloud Opportunity

Organizations need secure computational environments for time-limited activities (M&A due diligence, crisis response, joint ventures) without persistent infrastructure overhead or data residue risks.

## 4. Summary of Invention

The present invention provides:

1. **Time-Bounded Cloud Creation**
   - Cryptographically enforced expiration
   - Automatic dissolution without intervention
   - No manual shutdown required
   - Precise temporal boundaries

2. **Zero-Residue Architecture**
   - Cryptographic key destruction
   - Memory entropy overwriting
   - Distributed proof of deletion
   - Audit trail generation

3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
   - Entropy-based resource distribution
   - Unpredictable infrastructure mapping
   - Anti-reconnaissance properties
   - Load balancing without patterns

## 5. Detailed Description

### 5.1 System Architecture
