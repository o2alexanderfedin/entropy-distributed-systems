## 1. Title of Invention

**System and Method for Generating Universal Basic Income Through Automated Monetization of Personal Computing Device Infrastructure with Tax-Optimized Settlement**

## 2. Field of Invention

This invention relates to economic systems and distributed computing, specifically to methods for creating self-funded universal basic income through automated monetization of idle computing resources while optimizing tax implications through graph-based payment cycle elimination.

## 3. Background and Problem Statement

### Current UBI Implementation Challenges

1. **Funding Crisis**
   - Traditional UBI requires massive taxation
   - $1,000/month for 200M adults = $2.4 trillion/year
   - Would need 50% increase in federal tax revenue
   - Creates economic drag and political resistance

2. **Idle Resource Waste**
   - 11.5 billion devices globally idle 80% of time
   - $3 trillion in underutilized hardware
   - No mechanism to monetize idle capacity
   - Depreciating assets generate no returns

3. **Tax Burden Issues**
   - Government UBI creates double taxation

## 14. Conclusion

This invention transforms the concept of universal basic income from a government transfer payment requiring massive taxation into a self-funded economic system that creates value for both enterprises and individuals. By recognizing and monetizing the infrastructure value of personal devices, we enable sustainable UBI without any government funding while reducing cloud costs for businesses.

The system's ability to optimize taxes through graph cycle elimination, treat income as business revenue with deductions, and operate without government involvement makes it politically feasible and economically efficient. This represents a fundamental reimagining of both UBI and distributed computing infrastructure.
