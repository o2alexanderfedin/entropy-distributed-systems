## 1. Title of Invention

**System and Method for Distributed Fog Computing with Cryptographic Privacy Enforcement and Regulatory Compliance Attestation**

## 2. Field of Invention

This invention relates to privacy-preserving distributed computing, specifically to methods for creating an intermediate fog computing layer that enforces data privacy regulations through cryptographic mechanisms, geographical constraints, and automated compliance attestation.

## 3. Background and Problem Statement

### Current Privacy Compliance Challenges

1. **Data Sovereignty Violations**
   - Cloud providers store data across jurisdictions
   - No technical enforcement of residency requirements
   - Cross-border transfers happen transparently
   - GDPR fines up to €20M or 4% global revenue

2. **Right to Be Forgotten Complexity**
   - No cryptographic proof of deletion
   - Data persists in backups and caches
   - Deletion requests take weeks to process
   - No way to verify complete erasure

3. **Purpose Limitation Failures**
   - Data used beyond original consent
   - No technical enforcement of purpose
   - Difficult to audit data usage
   - Secondary processing common

4. **Data Minimization Violations**
   - Full datasets sent to cloud
   - No edge processing capabilities
   - PII unnecessarily transmitted
   - Over-collection by design

### The Fog Computing Privacy Opportunity

Organizations need a technical solution that enforces privacy regulations automatically, provides cryptographic proof of compliance, and prevents data violations before they occur.

   - Differential privacy injection
   - Homomorphic encryption support

3. **Cryptographic Compliance Attestation**
   - Proof of data deletion
   - Processing audit trails
   - Purpose enforcement certificates
   - Time-bounded data retention

4. **Selective Cloud Synchronization**
   - Only compliant data to cloud
   - PII stripping at edge
   - Aggregation before transmission
   - Consent-based filtering
