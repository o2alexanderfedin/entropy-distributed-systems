# Patent Innovation Document #7: Device-Based Infrastructure-as-a-Service Monetization

**Technology Area**: Edge Computing, Infrastructure Monetization, Distributed Systems  
**Innovation Type**: System and Method  
**AI-Assisted Development**: Yes - Developed with substantial contributions from AI Hive®  

## 1. Title of Invention

**System and Method for Monetizing Personal Computing Devices as Distributed Infrastructure Services with Enterprise-Grade Feature Provision**

## 2. Field of Invention

This invention relates to edge computing and infrastructure monetization, specifically to methods for transforming personal computing devices into revenue-generating infrastructure assets that provide enterprise-grade cloud services including geographic redundancy, edge computing, and high availability.

## 3. Background and Problem Statement

### Current Resource Utilization Problem

1. **Massive Idle Capacity**
   - Personal devices idle 80-95% of time
   - 6.5 billion smartphones underutilized
   - Gaming consoles idle 20+ hours/day
   - Laptops closed 16+ hours/day

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Costs**
   - Enterprises spend $600B on cloud
   - Edge computing costs skyrocketing
   - Multi-region deployments expensive
   - 5G edge requires massive investment

3. **Economic Inequality**
   - Device owners pay for depreciating assets
   - No return on computing investment
   - Cloud providers capture all value
   - Users need additional income sources

4. **Infrastructure Limitations**
   - Data centers far from users
   - No true edge computing
   - Limited geographic distribution
   - High energy consumption

### The Infrastructure Monetization Opportunity

Personal devices collectively represent more computing power than all data centers combined, naturally provide geographic distribution and true edge computing, yet generate zero revenue for owners.

## 4. Summary of Invention

The present invention provides:

1. **Infrastructure Service Valuation**
   - Recognizes devices provide multiple services
   - Values geographic distribution premium
   - Prices edge computing appropriately
   - Accounts for redundancy value

2. **Automatic Service Orchestration**
   - Maps device capabilities to services
   - Orchestrates multi-device infrastructure
   - Provides enterprise SLAs
   - Manages availability windows

3. **Micro-Datacenter Operations**
   - Treats device owners as operators
   - Compensates for power/network/space
   - Rewards maintenance activities
   - Enables infrastructure entrepreneurship
