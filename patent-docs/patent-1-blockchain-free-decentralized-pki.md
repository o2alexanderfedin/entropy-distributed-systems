### 5.2 Novel Method Steps

1. **Identity Generation**
   ```python
   def generate_identity(password: str, device_id: bytes) -> Identity:
       # Step 1: Derive master seed from password
       master_seed = argon2id(
           password=password,
           salt=SHA256(password),  # Deterministic salt
           memory=1GB,
           iterations=10,
           parallelism=4
       )
       
       # Step 2: Bind to device
       device_key = HMAC_SHA256(master_seed, device_id)
       
       # Step 3: Generate identity keys
       identity_private = Ed25519_derive(device_key)
       identity_public = Ed25519_public(identity_private)
       
       # Step 4: Create self-signed certificate
       certificate = create_certificate(
           public_key=identity_public,
           device_binding=SHA256(device_id),
           timestamp=current_time(),
           expiry=current_time() + 30_days
       )
       
       # Step 5: Sign certificate
       signature = Ed25519_sign(certificate, identity_private)
       
       return Identity(certificate, signature)
   ```

2. **DHT Publication (Blockchain-Free)**
   ```python
   def publish_to_dht(identity: Identity, dht_network: DHT):
       # Calculate DHT key from public key
       dht_key = SHA256(identity.public_key)
       
       # Publish without blockchain
       dht_network.put(
           key=dht_key,
           value=identity.certificate,
           ttl=30_days,
           replication=20  # Redundancy without consensus
       )
   ```

3. **Verification Without Trusted Third Parties**
   ```python
   def verify_identity(public_key: bytes, dht_network: DHT) -> bool:
       # Retrieve from DHT (no blockchain needed)
       dht_key = SHA256(public_key)
       certificates = dht_network.get(dht_key)
       
       # Verify self-signature
       for cert in certificates:
           if Ed25519_verify(cert.signature, cert.data, public_key):
               if cert.expiry > current_time():
                   return True
       return False
   ```
