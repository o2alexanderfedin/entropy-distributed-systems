## 1. Define ±20% Tolerance for Theoretical Projections (Line 145)

### Academic Sources:
- **ScienceDirect - Analytical Method Validation**: Research demonstrates that minimal values for confidence levels (β%) are typically chosen as 80%, 90%, or 95%, which means that no more than 20%, 10%, or 5%, respectively, of future measurements will fall outside predefined acceptance limits. This establishes ±20% tolerance as a widely accepted standard in validation studies.
  - Source: [Using tolerance intervals in pre-study validation of analytical methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021967307005535)

- **Engineering Applications**: In parallel dual-output phase-shift full-bridge converters, researchers have analyzed the impact of ±20% uniform tolerances in inductance parameters through 30,000 PLECS simulations incorporating randomized parameters, validating the effectiveness of ±20% tolerance bounds in predicting performance outcomes.

- **Biopharmaceutical Standards**: Tolerances are commonly set based on a percentage of the mean (±10% or ±20%), with all limits ideally based on transfer functions, correlations, or models.
  - Source: [Essentials in Tolerance Design and Setting Specification Limits](https://www.biopharminternational.com/view/essentials-tolerance-design-and-setting-specification-limits)

### Key Finding:

### Key Finding:
Performance degradation limits should be set using percentile-based thresholds (p90, p95, p99) with clear numeric boundaries that align with business objectives and customer expectations.
